                        When most people think of AI, they think in a broad sense: a form of computer science
                        that gives machines some sort of human intelligence. However, to further understand it,
                        AI can be broken into 3 main stages:

                            <p>
                                Often called Weak AI, ANI is super-human at specific singular tasks.
                                Like teaching an AI machine to play chess! It will master singular
                                tasks beyond human potential with incredible consistency.
                            </p>
                            <li><h4>Stages of AI: 2 – AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)</h4></li>
                            <p>
                                AGI would mean a machine would be capable of understanding the world
                                as well as any human. All while maintaining the same capacity to learn
                                how to carry out a huge range of tasks. The reality?  AGI is not yet
                                among us. It is a hypothetical form of AI. The potential is there but
                                some believe it to be decades away!

                                To determine if a machine is truly AGI, it has to pass the Turing, 
                                the coffee, the robot college and the employment tests.

                            </p>
                            <li><h4>Stages of AI: 3 – ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)</h4></li>
                            <p>
                                Oxford Philosopher Nick Bostrom describes ASI as: “any intellect that
                                greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all
                                domains of interest.” Again, this is a hypothetical agent and one which
                                is decades away.

                                ASI has huge potential but it also has huge risk. Stephen Hawking feared
                                its development could be the worst event in the history of our civilisation,
                                and even ‘spell the end of the human race‘. If we create super-intelligent
                                machines we may put our own existence at risk. However, right now this is
                                just the plot for another sci-fi film.
                            </p>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p align="justify">
                        The reality is that AI is a tool for humans to better our existence. Advancements
                        in artificial intelligence mean the sky’s the limit! The question is – will the
                        limit bring more positives or negatives?

                    </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        As we integrate AI into our society, ethical concerns must be at the centre of our
                        thinking. In an AI-driven society, how can we assure equality, minimise bias, and
                        protect privacy? Will AI improve our human experience, or will it unintentionally
                        deepen the gaps in inequality?

                        The desired outcome would be for AI to be an ally in the fight for a better world,
                        but ideas must be carefully directed before they can become a reality. Furthermore,
                        discussions around AI should not be limited to engineers or ethical thinkers; it
                        should include everyone. Every voice, from legislators to educators, entrepreneurs
                        to citizens, provides a crucial perspective to how we develop this technology.

                        We must tread carefully with AI whilst simultaneously embracing all the stages of it.

                    <p align="justify">
                        Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various
                        types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz
                        around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new user interfaces for
                        creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds. Here you can
                        see a video tutorial of OpenAI's DALL.E2, one of the most powerful text-to-image
                        generator currently available.

                    <p align="justify">
                        The technology, it should be noted, is not brand-new. Generative AI was introduced in
                        the 1960s in chatbots. But it was not until 2014, with the introduction of generative
                        adversarial networks, or GANs -- a type of machine learning algorithm -- that generative
                        AI could create convincingly authentic images, videos and audio of real people.
                    </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        On the one hand, this newfound capability has opened up opportunities that include
                        better movie dubbing and rich educational content. It also unlocked concerns about
                        deepfakes -- digitally forged images or videos -- and harmful cybersecurity attacks
                        on businesses, including nefarious requests that realistically mimic an employee's boss.
                    </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        Two additional recent advances that will be discussed in more detail below have played
                        a critical part in generative AI going mainstream: transformers and the breakthrough
                        language models they enabled. Transformers are a type of machine learning that made
                        it possible for researchers to train ever-larger models without having to label all of
                        the data in advance. New models could thus be trained on billions of pages of text,
                        resulting in answers with more depth. In addition, transformers unlocked a new notion
                        called attention that enabled models to track the connections between words across pages,
                        chapters and books rather than just in individual sentences. And not just words:
                        Transformers could also use their ability to track connections to analyze code, proteins,
                        chemicals and DNA.

                        or even trillions of parameters -- have opened a new era in which generative AI models can
                        write engaging text, paint photorealistic images and even create somewhat entertaining
                        sitcoms on the fly. Moreover, innovations in multimodal AI enable teams to generate content
                        across multiple types of media, including text, graphics and video. This is the basis for
                        tools like Dall-E that automatically create images from a text description or generate text
                        captions from images.

                    <p align="justify">
                        These breakthroughs notwithstanding, we are still in the early days of using generative AI
                        to create readable text and photorealistic stylized graphics. Early implementations have
                        had issues with accuracy and bias, as well as being prone to hallucinations and spitting
                        back weird answers. Still, progress thus far indicates that the inherent capabilities of
                        this generative AI could fundamentally change enterprise technology how businesses operate.
                        Going forward, this technology could help write code, design new drugs, develop products,
                        redesign business processes and transform supply chains.

                    <p align="justify">

                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        Companies from giants like Google to startups like Runway, have already
                        revealed text-to-video AI projects. But OpenAI says that Sora is
                        distinguished by its striking photorealism—something I haven’t seen in
                        its competitors—and its ability to produce longer clips than the brief
                        snippets other models typically do, up to one minute.
                    </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        The researchers I spoke to won’t say how long it takes to render all that video, but
                        when pressed, they described it as more in the “going out for a burrito”
                        ballpark than “taking a few days off.” If the hand-picked examples I saw
                        are to be believed, the effort is worth it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p align="justify">
                        OpenAI didn’t let me enter my own prompts, but it shared four instances
                        of Sora’s power. (None approached the purported one-minute limit; the
                        longest was 17 seconds.)
                    </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        The first came from a detailed prompt that sounded like an obsessive
                        screenwriter’s setup: “Beautiful, snowy Tokyo city is bustling. The
                        camera moves through the bustling city street, following several
                        people enjoying the beautiful snowy weather and shopping at nearby
                        stalls. Gorgeous sakura petals are flying through the wind along
                        with snowflakes.”
                    </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        The result is a convincing view of what is unmistakably Tokyo, in that
                        magic moment when snowflakes and cherry blossoms coexist. The virtual
                        camera, as if affixed to a drone, follows a couple as they slowly stroll
                        through a streetscape. One of the passersby is wearing a mask. Cars
                        rumble by on a riverside roadway to their left, and to the right
                        shoppers flit in and out of a row of tiny shops. You can see the video
                        of the result next:

                    <p align="justify">
                        As for now, OpenAI is faced with the huge task of making sure that Sora
                        isn’t a misinformation train wreck. But after that, the long countdown
                        begins until the next Christopher Nolan or Celine Song gets a statuette
                        for wizardry in prompting an AI model. The envelope, please!
